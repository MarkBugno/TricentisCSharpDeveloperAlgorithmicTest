# Box Corp. Box Choosing Algorithm
## Our Objective
We here at Box Corp. are very concerned with boxes (rectangles). People often send us files full of box specifications, and we are responsible for chosing the best boxes from each file. In order to get only the finest boxes:
1. we remove any poor quality boxes; and
2. when boxes significantly overlap, we choose the best quality box among them.

## How do we choose the best boxes? 
Boxes come in CSV files. [Here's](./src/BoxChooser/boxes.csv) the one you'll be working with. There may be a large number of boxes in the file. A file has 5 columns and a single-row header record. Each subsequent row describes a box. The rows (boxes) are not sorted. The columns are:
* two positive integer coordinates (`x` and `y`), representing the lower x and y bounds of the box;
* two positive integer dimensions (`width` and `height`), representing the size of the box; and,
* one floating-point value (`quality`), between 0 and 1 inclusive.

Quality is a representation of how important the box is to us. A higher quality value will mean the box is more important (e.g., a box with quality = 0.8 is more important than a box with quality = 0.4). When forced to choose, we want to retain higher quality boxes.

An example of a box file with a single box might look like this:
| x | y | width | height | quality |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 2 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 0.6 |

The box in this file would look like this:

When we receive a box file, we want to *discard* any low quality boxes. Boxes with `quality < 0.5` should be discarded.

Next, we need to check whether any of the boxes significantly overlap other boxes. When two boxes significantly overlap each other, we want to retain the higher-quality box. The eliminated box is said to be *suppressed*. Two boxes are determined to significantly overlap if their intersection over union (IoU) is `â‰¥ 0.4`. The formula for calculating IoU is: `IoU = <intersecting area of the boxes> / <union area of the boxes>`

As an example of the overall process, if we received a file with the below data, we would expect each box to be treated as shown.
* Box E (purple) is discarded as it's quality is too low.
* Box D (yellow) is retained, because it doesn't overlap any other box.
* Box C (blue) is retained, because the only box it significantly overlaps is Box B (green), and it has a higher quality than Box B.
* Box B (green) is suppressed because it significantly overlaps Box C (blue) and has lower quality than Box C.
* Box A (red) is retained because the only box it significantly overlaps is Box B (green), and Box B has already been eliminated by Box C (blue).

It's important to note that the order in which you suppress boxes will affect which boxes are suppressed. You need to process the file such that the highest quality boxes are retained and you need to avoid suppressing boxes unnecessarily. In the above example, if we compared boxes A and B before we compared A and C, we would suppress both box A (from the first comparison) and box B (from the second comparison). This is unnecessary and undesirable, as the highest quality box A suppresses box B, meaning nothing is left to significantly overlap box C. What order do you think the file should be processed in to guarantee boxes aren't unnecessarily eliminated?

## What outcome do we want?
We want a CSV file containing the list of all retained boxes (all boxes neither discarded nor suppressed). We also want a printout of the number of boxes retained, discarded (due to low quality), and suppressed (due to overlapping significantly).

## What do we want you to do?
A solution exists in [the src directory](./src). This solution contains a sample [box file](./src/BoxChooser/boxes.csv). Write a program to satisfy the requirements above. Feel free to replace any/all existing code. You will be judged based on:
1. Accuracy: your algorithm needs to choose the correct boxes.
2. Code Quality: your code needs to be clean and maintainable.
3. Performance: your code needs to be efficient/fast.

There are `10,000` boxes in the file. `2510` boxes will be retained, `5026` boxes will be discarded, and `2464` boxes will be suppressed. The solution should take less than `1 second` to run.
